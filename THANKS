v0.5.0:

The initial rapid development of slibtool, and likewise the
relatively short time from inception to first release, would not have
been possible without the shared wisdom and tremendous help that was
provided by Kylie McClain, a renowned Exherbo Linux developer and build
system wizard. Kylie tirelessly tested slibtool by running the Exherbo
world build time and again around the clock until there no more visible
failures (read: until she finally stopped jinxing it), handling the
tediousness of the task with a cool spirit and a great sense of humor.

Thanks also to Ørjan Malde (the one and only), who readily turned
himself into a Somemulator and helped debugging a race condition in
slibtool's compile mode translation unit (commit cd7387f).
